# Polynomial-Multiplication-OOP-Java

## Overview

This project is a Java application that multiplies two polynomial quadratic equations using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts. The program efficiently handles the parsing, multiplication, and sorting of polynomial terms.

## Features

- *Object-Oriented Design:* Utilizes classes to represent terms and equations.
- *Efficient Term Sorting:* Implements quick sort for optimal performance.
- *Flexible Input:* Supports various polynomial formats.
- *Pattern Matching:* Combines like terms for simplified output.

## Code Structure

- Term.java: Represents a single term in a polynomial.
- Equation.java: Represents a polynomial equation as a collection of terms.
- EquationMultiplication.java: The main program that handles input, processes the equations, and outputs the result.

## Usage

1. *Clone the repository:*
    bash
    git clone https://github.com/gowthamsp17/Java-Polynomial-Multiplier-OOP
    
2. *Navigate to the project directory:*
    bash
    cd Java-Polynomial-Multiplier-OOP
    
3. *Compile and run the program:*
    bash
    javac EquationMultiplication.java
    java EquationMultiplication
    

4. *Input Example:*
    - Enter two polynomial equations like 2x^2 + y^4z^3 - 5xy and -2x + 8y^3.

5. *Output:*
    - The program will display the product of the two polynomials.

## Example

```plaintext
Enter two equations (Eg : 2x^2 + y^4z^3 - 5xy - 0yz^2 + 0)
Equation 1 : x^2 + y^3
Equation 2 : 4y^3 + 3z^1

Multiplication result: 4x^2y^3 + 3x^2z + 4y^6 + 3y^3z
```

## Requirements

- Java 8 or higher
